int SOCKET(int DOMAIN, int TYPE, int PROTOCOL);

    - / SOCKET / creates  an endpoint for communication and returns a file de‚Äê
    scriptor that refers to that endpoint.

    - / DOMAIN / selects the protocol family which will be used for communication
    in our case (SUBJECT.PDF) its AF_INET (IPv4) or AF_INET6 (IPv6).

    - / TYPE / specifies the communication semantics. SOCK_STREAM should work for us
    because it is stable and most used when TCP is used.

    - / PROTOCOL / 0 means the system will use the default protocol for the domain and
    type chosen. Or we can chose (IPPROTO_TCP) because our cas is TCP. But just to know
    0 is the most used.

    - On Success RETURNS a int fd, On Error -1 (PROTECTION)


int CLOSE(int FD) - WE ALREADY KNOW
